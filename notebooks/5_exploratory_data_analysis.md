- Gender distribution (pie chart)
- Location analysis (city/state heatmaps)
- Income bracket distribution
- Education level distribution
- Subscription plan distribution
- Account status distribution
- Tenure analysis (histogram + correlation with churn)

#### **3.2 Transaction Analysis**
- Transaction amount distribution (histogram + box plot)
- Transaction type distribution
- Payment method usage

- International vs domestic transactions
- Transaction frequency per customer
- Monthly/seasonal transaction patterns

#### **3.3 Churn Analysis (Target Variable)**
- Churn rate over time
- Churn by demographics (age, gender, location, income)
- Churn by transaction behavior
- Churn by subscription plan
- Churn by tenure
- Churn by engagement metrics

#### **3.4 Correlation and Relationship Analysis**
- Correlation matrix heatmap for numerical variables
- Feature importance for churn prediction
- Relationship between transaction behavior and churn
- Customer lifetime value analysis
- Risk score correlation with churn

### **Section 4: Feature Engineering Insights**
- Identify most predictive features for churn
- Create new features based on patterns discovered
- Analyze feature interactions
- Suggest feature selection strategies

### **Section 5: Statistical Analysis**
- Perform statistical tests (chi-square, t-tests, ANOVA)
- Calculate confidence intervals
- Identify significant differences between churned and active customers

### **Section 6: Business Insights and Recommendations**
- Key findings summary
- Actionable business recommendations
- Customer segmentation insights
- Risk factors for churn
- Retention strategy suggestions

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 12))
fig.suptitle('Churn Rate Analysis by Demographics', fontsize=16, fontweight='bold')

# Age groups vs churn
age_churn = df.groupby('age_group')['account_status'].apply(lambda x: (x == 'Churned').mean())
age_churn.plot(kind='bar', ax=axes[0,0], color='skyblue')
axes[0,0].set_title('Churn Rate by Age Group')
axes[0,0].set_ylabel('Churn Rate')
axes[0,0].tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)

# Similar plots for other demographics...
```

### **Example 2: Transaction Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Interactive plotly visualization for transaction patterns
fig = make_subplots(
    rows=2, cols=2,
    subplot_titles=('Transaction Amount Distribution', 'Transaction Type vs Churn',
                   'Monthly Transaction Trends', 'Customer Lifetime Value')
)

# Add traces for each subplot...
fig.update_layout(height=800, title_text="Transaction Pattern Analysis")
fig.show()
```
